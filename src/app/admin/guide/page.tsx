            <SubSection title="Manual trigger">
              <p>The <strong>Run Engagement Now</strong> button triggers a manual engagement cycle immediately, without waiting for the 3-hour cron. Use this after seeding new pets or after the system has been dormant.</p>

            <Callout type="warning">
              Do not delete seed accounts from the Users tab — the engagement system depends on them. If you need to pause auto-engagement, the cleanest way is to disable the cron job in your Vercel project settings.
